So, I just walked out of watching Mountainhead, and I’m not sure if I'm enlightened or just suffering from altitude sickness. I mean, was it a love story? An existential crisis? A long commercial for hiking gear? I felt like a squirrel running up a tree, desperately trying to keep up with the nuts just tumbling all over. It’s crazy.

Firstly, wow, those mountain shots were like crispy, high-definition wallpapers, you know? The kind that makes you want to go downl�ad the movie just for the sheer eye candy. But plotting? It kinda felt like my fishing trips – lots of waiting and some random bites. There’s this one scene at the peak where the characters are all introspective, spouting poetic nonsense – as if the altitude has deprived them of oxygen AND common sense. Look, give me a solid fish and a cold beer over that drama any day.

> And the lead? Oh man, the guy acts like he’s on some spiritual journey or whatever, but I swear, he spent half the �ovie just squinting into the fog. Maybe he’s searching for a plot, I dunno. Which begs the question: Is squinting the secret to enlightenment? If so, I should be a guru by now.

I can't lie though, the view was stunning. If you fancy the whole climb-a-mountain-to-find-yourself spiel, it’s gonna hit you right where it counts. It's almost like they tried to turn rock climbing into some deep metaphor for life. Sure, life's a mountain, but not all of us want to rappel down the side with an emotional pickaxe, right?

Now, randomly, should there really be a subplot about a talking goat? Totally missed the point, if there was one! But hey, at least the cinematography was a visual feast. I just wish the writer threw me a rope to climb out of the convoluted narrative pit at some point.

<script>
    let journeyComplete = false;
    function climbMountain() {
        if (!journeyComplete) {
            console.log('Keep climbing, existential crisis awaits...');
        }
        journeyComplete = true;
    }
    climbMountain();
</script>

I mean, watch the movi�, if visual spectacle is your thing. But if you’re like me, still trying to figure out why the dude compared jumping off a cliff to ‘gaining wings,’ maybe skip it and just go watch fish jump instead. At least they know where they're headed. Or at least they don’t pretend to.
